The Cardinal Health Management System is a real-time database application aimed at revolutionizing hospital management, developed using SQL Server, Azure Data Studio, and PowerApps for the frontend. This application enhances hospital operational efficiency by maintaining comprehensive patient records, scheduling, bed availability, and insurance and billing information. Our project facilitates administrative decision-making and improves patient care by streamlining processes for appointments, medical history tracking, and resource management. Through a well-structured database encompassing 15+ tables and adept use of SQL queries, we've created a system that significantly contributes to healthcare infrastructure by managing records of doctors, patients, medicines, and bed availability efficiently.
